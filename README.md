# Twitch-Api-Viewer
Want to see what your fave streamers are doing, look no further.

## What it does
Based on a list of stream names that can be added to the .js file it returns a list
of elements that contain stream info, or lack thereof. Things like if the stream is live,
or how many viewers it has, or what game is being played, are all on display

## Config
Not much to do here other than to edit the first line of the index.js file
```
var channelNames = ['ESL_SC2', 'OgamingSC2', 'wintergaming', 'freecodecamp', 'shroud', 'summit1g', 'GauntletSC2', 'brunofin'];
```
and add your fave streamers in place of the ones already there and enjoy.
